.......So, here we are after 5 eventful years
Though, don't get overjoyed, it wasn't without the occasional hiccups and a bit of tears
But, may be that is what Marriage is all about
It's not like as if you had some bad days, and you want to bail out

people say, the magic in marriage fades away with each year passing by
May be it's true, but then...Do the relations too slowly die?
Will there be only exasperation, anguish and repulsion, filling the vaccum?
Don't have the answer...but definitely it haunts and make things look very gloom.

But, Us...I am so always hopeful about us and had so many things to like about us
May be we're a tiny bit of exception among so many other norms and a little bit sparse.
If you still want to know why? then just try to measure the time we spent alone together 
Difficult or what!...hope the same continues and we live happily ever after.


The times, we spent together and the memories, will forever stay in my heart,
And will stay in my thoughts, and will play in my mind like the melodies of some sort.
Just know, I still love you and don't believe anything else to be true,
And finally, without further ado, just want to say a very happy anniversary to you.
