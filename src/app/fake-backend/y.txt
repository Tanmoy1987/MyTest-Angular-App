.......So, here we are after 5 eventful years
Though, don't get overjoyed, it wasn't without the occasional hiccups and a bit of tears
But, may be that is what Marriage is all about
It's not like as if you are sad and tired, so you want to bail out
Some wise man said, Marriage is for the ages and lifetimes,
